# Notes

## Spaces

- You can insert spaces from the "Insert > Space & Breaks" Menu.
- You can only insert spaces that are defined in the current font.
- You can define shortcuts for the spaces (see the Shortcuts section in the Preferences)
- You can use (and modify if it does not fit) one of the two Autoquote scripts that are distributed with Scribus itself.

## French rules

### Spaces and ponctuation

In my experience, most french speaking people simply insert a space. It's a pain, but this is what most are used to.
The result is that they are not very picky on the width of the space, but some space must be!

Most designers speak of a thin space (espace fine), so this is probably the most common choice in typography.

In the Web you can find some documents giving hints on which spaces you can / should use in which context, but most just say: "use a space". Here is a detailed link that could be helpful:
